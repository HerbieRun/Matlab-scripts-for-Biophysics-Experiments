#### Matlab scripts for Experimental Biophysics
##### --> Will includes scripts for LS (light-scattering), SAXS(small-angle x-ray scattering), updating~~
##### --> Added: For MALS (multi-angl light scattering), generating a Zimm Plot
##### --> Added: For MALS, calculating Rg value (radius of gyration)
##### --> Added: SVDalign, rigid body transformation -- structural comparison
##### --> Added: For computational structural biophysics usage: MyBarnestHut, TreeEnergy, TreeTraveler, OcTree, MCMC
